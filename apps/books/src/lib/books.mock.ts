        "description": "Coding with AngularJS For DummiesWell, you're in good hands !But we have a long road, you and me, with lots of things to learn: ).We're living exciting times in Web development. There is a new Angular. A complete rewrite of the good old AngularJS. Why a complete rewrite? Was AngularJS 1.x not enough?I like the old AngularJS very much. In our small company, we have built several projects with it, contributed code to the core framework, trained hundreds of developers (yes, really), and even written a book about it (in French, but that still counts).AngularJS is incredibly productive once you have mastered it. Despite all of this, it doesn't preventus from seeing its weaknesses. AngularJS is not perfect, with some very difficult concepts to grasp, and traps hard to avoid.Most of all, the Web has changed since AngularJS was conceived. JavaScript has changed. ***New frameworks have emerged, with great ideas, or better implementation. We are not the kind of developers to tell you that you should use this tool instead of that one. We just happen to know some tools very well, and know what fits the project. AngularJS was one of those tools, allowing usto build well-tested web applications, and to build them fast. We also tried to bend it where it didn'tfit. Don't blame us, it happens to the best of us.Will Angular be the tool we will use without hesitation in our future projects? It's hard to say right now, because the framework is really young and the ecosystem only just blooming.But Angular has a lot of interesting points, and a vision that few other frameworks have. It has been designed for the Web of tomorrow, with ECMAScript 6, Web Components and Mobile in mind.When it was first announced, I was, like many, sad at first that the 2.0 version would not be a simple update (I'm sorry if you're just learning about it).***But I was also eager to see what solution the talented Google team would come up with.So I started to write this ebook, pretty much after the first commits, reading the design docs, watching the conference videos, reviewing every commit since the beginning. When I wrote my first ebook, about AngularJS 1.x, it was already a stable and known beast. This one is very different, it started when Angular was not even clear in the minds of its designers. Because I knew I wouldlearn a lot, not only about Angular but also about the concepts that would shape the future of Web development, some of which have nothing to do with Angular. And I did. I had to dig a lot about some of these concepts, and I hope that you will enjoy the journey of learning about them, and how they relate to Angular, as much as I did.The ambition of this ebook is to evolve with Angular. If it turns out that Angular is the great framework we hope, you will receive updates with the best practices and some new features as they emerge (and with fewer typos, because, despite our countless reviews, there are probably some left...). And I would love to hear back from you - if some chapters aren't clear enough, if you spot a mistake or if you have a better way for some parts.I'm fairly confident about the code samples, though, as they are all in a real project, with several hundred unit tests. It was the only way to write an ebook with a newborn framework, and to beable to catch all the problems that inevitably arose with each release.Even if you are not convinced by Angular in the end, I'm pretty sure you will have learnt a thing or two along your read.",

        "description": "A definitive guide on frontend development with Angular from design to deployment Key FeaturesDevelop web applications from scratch using Angular and TypeScriptExplore reactive programming principles and RxJS to develop and test apps easilyStudy continuous integration and deployment on the AWS cloudBook Description If you have been burnt by unreliable JavaScript frameworks before, you will be amazed by the maturity of the Angular platform. Angular enables you to build fast, efficient, and real-world web apps. In this Learning Path, you'll learn Angular and to deliver high-quality and production-grade Angular apps from design to deployment. You will begin by creating a simple fitness app, using the building blocks of Angular, and make your final app, Personal Trainer, by morphing the workout app into a full-fledged personal workout builder and runner with an advanced directive building - the most fundamental and powerful feature of Angular. You will learn the different ways of architecting Angular applications using RxJS, and some of the patterns that are involved in it. Later you’ll be introduced to the router-first architecture, a seven-step approach to designing and developing mid-to-large line-of-business apps, along with popular recipes. By the end of this book, you will be familiar with the scope of web development using Angular, Swagger, and Docker, learning patterns and practices to be successful as an individual developer on the web or as a team in the Enterprise. This Learning Path includes content from the following Packt products: Angular 6 by Example by Chandermani Arora, Kevin HennessyArchitecting Angular Applications with Redux, RxJS, and NgRx by Christoffer NoringAngular 6 for Enterprise-Ready Web Applications by Doguhan UlucaWhat you will learnDevelop web applications from scratch using Angular and TypeScriptExplore reactive programming principles, RxJS to develop and test apps efficientlyStudy continuous integration and deployment your Angular app on the AWS cloudWho this book is for If you're a JavaScript or frontend developer looking to gain comprehensive experience of using Angular for end-to-end enterprise-ready applications, this Learning Path is for you.",

You need not have any knowledge of on Angular or its services. What You Will Learn Explore various features and topics involved in modules, services, and dependency injection Sketch and create wire-frames for your project Use controllers to collect data and populate them into NG UIs Create a controller and the required directives to build a tree data structure Implement a logic to decide the relevancy of any given evidence Create a partially-AI service Build controllers to set the template for the report Collect, investigate, perform decision making, and generate reports in one the big automated process In Detail A primary concern with modern day applications is that they need to be dynamic, and for that, data access from the server side, data authentication, and security are very important. Angular leverages its services to create such state-of-the-art dynamic applications. This book will help you create and design customized services, integrate them into your applications, import third-party plugins, and make your apps perform better and faster. This book starts with a basic rundown on how you can create your own Angular development environment compatible with v2 and v4. You will then use Bootstrap and Angular UI components to create pages. You will also understand how to use controllers to collect data and populate them into NG UIs. Later, you will then create a rating service to evaluate entries and assign a score to them. Next, you will create \"cron jobs\" in NG. We will then create a crawler service to find all relevant resources regarding a selected headline and generate reports on it. Finally, you will create a service to manage accuracy and provide feedback about troubled areas in the app created. This book is up to date for the 2.4 release and is compatible with the 4.0 release as well, and it does not have any code based on the beta or release candidates. Style and approach This step-by-step tutorial starts by showing how you can create your first Angular services, then customizing it to suit your needs, and finally implementing some real-world case studies on your own to make you confident designing your own application using effective services from scratch.",
